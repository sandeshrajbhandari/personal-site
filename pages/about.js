          <p>
            Hi, I am Sandesh, a Mechanical Engineer by profession, and
            passionate about programming and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started learning to code since high school, but never had the time
            or patience to dedicate my self to the craft. This site is my
            attempt at getting back in to the world of coding and track my
            progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a Mechanical Engineering Degree from Institute of
            Engineering, Tribhuwan University. I spend my free time reading
            books, messing with 3D Art, Photography and coding.
          </p>
